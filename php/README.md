PHP add-on by Community Hass.io add-ons.

## About

This is a PHP add-on for Hass.io. When started, it provides a
PHP server serving web conetnt from the /data persistent volume.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Home Assistant add-on.

1. Search for the "PHP" add-on in the Supervisor add-on store and install it.
1. Start the "PHP" add-on.
1. Check the logs of the "PHP" add-on to see it in action.

## Configuration

PHP add-on configuration:

```yaml
log_level: info
```

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`:  Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.
